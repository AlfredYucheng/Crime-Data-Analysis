# GOAL
The  goal  of  this  project  is  toexplore  which  factors  influence  the  number  of  seriouscrimes per county.  In the project, we used theCrimeData.  And we determine the crimelevel by taking the quantile of the log of crime ratio in each county and fitting thelogisticregression.The final result shows thatthe population density,the interaction of the hospital bedsper area and below poverty rateandper capital incomehave the highest influence ona countyâ€™s crime level.Therefore,  the  government  should  focus  ondecreasing  the  population  density,belowpoverty rate,increasing hospital beds per area and per capital incomein order todecrease crime number
